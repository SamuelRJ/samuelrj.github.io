//Refactor 10/2/2022:
/*
Currently have particle array without mass and charge.
Need to have num of protons, neutrons, and electrons.


*/

//TODO:
// - Make orbitals for atoms. Shiftable based on surrounding fields.
// - Make electron energy go somewhere when combining
// - Allow high-energy electrons to knock out other electrons. Or excite it. Ionization energy vs excitation energy
// - Add mini version that Jean can walk to. And interact with. Make multiple.

/* Chemistry!

Learn about the proton and electron. Then neutron. Then hygrogen, then helium, and so on.
Learn what happens when you mix it with itself. And with other chemicals.
Every example of mixing introduces you to a new element. Like factorio.
  Maybe each example is representative of a particular type of reaction or something. I don't remember enough about chemistry so this'll be fun to relearn from this perspective.

/* Next Steps */

// When making a proton, have option that shows what atom you're making.
// Have neutron options. The natural isotopes. Pick one or you can choose all of them in natural quantities.
// What if you have an extra neutron? I bet we could calculate that.

/* Holy crap, go back to level 0 for this one:
You shoot an electron through a magnetic field and do the spin-detection experiment.
Portray that as the electron's probability cloud splitting.
And as soon the sensor detects it, the cloud disappears.. condenses to a point at the sensor.
So of course it took the shortest route. Every longer route didn't have a chance to exist.
*/

/* Better field visualization */
// Add a slider that lets you adjust field spread exponent. So you can see the field of a single electron and a single proton.
